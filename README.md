# Tailwind UI Issue Tracker

This is where we keep track of any bugs discovered in [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com).

**Please note the issue tracker is not for technical support questions.**

If you have questions about things like integrating a component into your project, tweaking a design in a particular way, accomplishing some interactive behavior with JavaScript, etc., we recommend joining the Tailwind UI Discord community and asking your question to the group:

**[Join the Tailwind UI Discord Community](https://tailwindui.com/discord)**

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not offer technical support or consulting**. We do hang out in the Discord community ourselves and will happily chime in with answers or advice if we see a question we are able to help with, but we don't guarantee first-party technical support as part of your purchase.
